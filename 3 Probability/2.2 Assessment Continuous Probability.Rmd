# Questions 1 and 2: ACT scores, part 1

The ACT is a standardized college admissions test used in the United States. The four multi-part questions in this assessment all involve simulating some ACT test scores and answering probability questions about them.

For the three year period 2016-2018, [ACT standardized test scores](http://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/national-ranks.html) were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. (Real ACT scores are integers between 1 and 36, but we will ignore this detail and use continuous values instead.)

First we'll simulate an ACT test score dataset and answer some questions about it.

Set the seed to 16, then use `rnorm()` to generate a normal distribution of 10000 tests with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. Save these values as `act_scores`. You'll be using this dataset throughout these four multi-part questions.

**(IMPORTANT NOTE! If you use R 3.6 or later, you will need to use the command format `set.seed(x, sample.kind = "Rounding")` instead of `set.seed(x)`. Your R version will be printed at the top of the Console window when you start RStudio.)**

```{r}
set.seed(16, sample.kind = "Rounding")
act_scores <- rnorm(10000, mean = 20.9, sd = 5.7)
```

### Question 1a 

What is the mean of `act_scores`?

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
mean(act_scores)
```

### Question 1b 

What is the standard deviation of `act_scores`?

```{r}
sd(act_scores)
```

### Question 1c 

A perfect score is 36 or greater (the maximum reported score is 36).

In `act_scores`, how many perfect scores are there out of 10,000 simulated tests?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
sum(act_scores >= 36)
```

### Question 1d 

In `act_scores`, what is the probability of an ACT score greater than 30?

```{r}
mean(act_scores > 30)
```

### Question 1e 

In `act_scores`, what is the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to 10?

```{r}
mean(act_scores <= 10)
```

### Question 2 

Set `x` equal to the sequence of integers 1 to 36. Use `dnorm` to determine the value of the probability density function over `x` given a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7; save the result as `f_x`. Plot `x` against `f_x`.

```{r}
x <- 1:36
f_x <- dnorm(x, mean=20.9, sd=5.7)
data.frame(x, f_x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, f_x)) +
  geom_line()
```

# Questions 3 and 4: ACT scores, part 2

In this 3-part question, you will convert raw ACT scores to Z-scores and answer some questions about them.

Convert `act_scores` to Z-scores. Recall from [Data Visualization](https://www.edx.org/course/r-data-visualization-2) (the second course in this series) that to standardize values (convert values into Z-scores, that is, values distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), you must subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation. Use the mean and standard deviation of `act_scores`, not the original values used to generate random test scores.

### Question 3a 

What is the probability of a Z-score greater than 2 (2 standard deviations above the mean)?

```{r}
z_scores <- (act_scores-mean(act_scores))/sd(act_scores)
mean(z_scores > 2)
#or
1-pnorm(2,0,1)
```

### Question 3b 

What ACT score value corresponds to 2 standard deviations above the mean (Z = 2)?

```{r}
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)
2*sd(act_scores) + mean(act_scores)
```

### Question 3c 

A Z-score of 2 corresponds roughly to the 97.5th percentile.

Use `qnorm()` to determine the 97.5th percentile of normally distributed data with the mean and standard deviation observed in `act_scores`.

What is the 97.5th percentile of `act_scores`?

```{r}
qnorm(0.975,20.9,5.7)
```

In this 4-part question, you will write a function to create a CDF for ACT scores.

Write a function that takes a value and produces the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to that value (the CDF). Apply this function to the range 1 to 36.

```{r}
cdf <- function(x){
  mean(act_scores <= x)
}
sapply(1:36, cdf)
```

### Question 4a 

What is the minimum integer score such that the probability of that score or lower is at least .95?

```{r}
x <- 1:36
min(which(sapply(1:36, cdf) >= 0.95))
```

### Question 4b 

Use `qnorm()` to determine the expected 95th percentile, the value for which the probability of receiving that score or lower is 0.95, given a mean score of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7.

What is the expected 95th percentile of ACT scores?

```{r}
qnorm(0.95, mean=20.9, sd=5.7)
```

### Question 4c 

As discussed in the Data Visualization course, we can use `quantile()` to determine sample quantiles from the data.

Make a vector containing the quantiles for `p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)`, the 1st through 99th percentiles of the `act_scores` data. Save these as `sample_quantiles`.

***In what percentile is a score of 26?***

Your answer should be an integer (i.e. 60), not a percent or fraction. Note that a score between the 98th and 99th percentile should be considered the 98th percentile, for example, and that quantile numbers are used as names for the vector `sample_quantiles`.

```{r}
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
sample_quantiles <- quantile(act_scores, p)
names(sample_quantiles[max(which(sample_quantiles < 26))])
```

1.  `which(sample_quantiles < 26)`: This part finds the indices where the values in `sample_quantiles` are less than 26. It returns a vector of indices where the condition is true.

2.  `max(which(sample_quantiles < 26))`: This part finds the maximum index from the indices obtained in step 1. This gives you the index of the highest quantile where the value is less than 26.

3.  `sample_quantiles[max(which(sample_quantiles < 26))]`: This part retrieves the actual quantile value corresponding to the maximum index found in step 2.

4.  `names(...)`: If `sample_quantiles` has names associated with its elements (perhaps it's a named vector), this part retrieves the name corresponding to the quantile value found in step 3.

### Question 4d 

Make a corresponding set of theoretical quantiles using `qnorm()` over the interval `p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)` with mean 20.9 and standard deviation 5.7. Save these as `theoretical_quantiles`. Make a QQ-plot graphing `sample_quantiles` on the y-axis versus `theoretical_quantiles` on the x-axis.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, 20.9, 5.7)
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()

#note: theoretical_quantiles are on the x-axis
#or
data.frame(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) %>%
  ggplot(aes(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline()
```
