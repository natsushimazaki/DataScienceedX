# DataCamp Assessment: Continuous Probability

# Exercise 1. Distribution of female heights - 1

Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 5 feet or shorter?

-   Use `pnorm` to define the probability that a height will take a value less than 5 feet given the stated distribution.
