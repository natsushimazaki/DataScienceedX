# Section 2 Overview

Section 2 introduces you to Continuous Probability.

After completing Section 2, you will:

-   understand the differences between calculating probabilities for discrete and continuous data.

-   be able to use cumulative distribution functions to assign probabilities to intervals when dealing with continuous data.

-   be able to use R to generate normally distributed outcomes for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

-   know some of the useful theoretical continuous distributions in addition to the normal distribution, such as the student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, and beta-binomial distributions.

# 2.1 Continuous Probability

## Continuous Probability

### Code: Cumulative distribution function

Define `x` as male heights from the **dslabs** `heights` dataset:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)
```

Given a vector **`x`**, we can define a function for computing the CDF of **`x`** using:

```{r}
F <- function(a) mean(x <= a)
1 - F(70)    # probability of male taller than 70 inches
```

## Theoretical Distribution

### Code: Using `pnorm()` to calculate probabilities

Given male heights `x`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)
```

We can estimate the probability that a male is taller than 70.5 inches using:

```{r}
1 - pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x))
```

### Code: Discretization and the normal approximation

```{r}
# plot distribution of exact heights in data
plot(prop.table(table(x)), xlab = "a = Height in inches", ylab = "Pr(x = a)")

# probabilities in actual data over length 1 ranges containing an integer
mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)

# probabilities in normal approximation match well
pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(67.5, mean(x), sd(x))
pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x))
pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x))

# probabilities in actual data over other ranges don't match normal approx as well
mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x <= 70.1)
pnorm(70.9, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(70.1, mean(x), sd(x))
```

## Probability Density

### ![](images/clipboard-383564387.png)

```{r}
avg <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
1 - pnorm(76, avg, s)
```

The curve is the probability density function for the normal distribution.

## Plotting the Probability Density

### Plotting the probability density for the normal distribution

![](images/clipboard-6192111.png)

We can use `dnorm()` to plot the density curve for the normal distribution. `dnorm(z)` gives the probability density of a certain z-score, so we can draw a curve by calculating the density over a range of possible values of z.

First, we generate a series of z-scores covering the typical range of the normal distribution. Since we know 99.7% of observations will be within , we can use a value of slightly larger than 3 and this will cover most likely values of the normal distribution. Then, we calculate , which is `dnorm()` of the series of z-scores. Last, we plot against .

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 100)
data.frame(x, f = dnorm(x)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x, f)) +
    geom_line()
```

Here is the resulting plot:

Note that `dnorm()` gives densities for the standard normal distribution by default. Probabilities for alternative normal distributions with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma` can be evaluated with:

```{r}
dnorm(z, mu, sigma)
```

## Monte Carlo Simulations

### Monte Carlo Simulations

`rnorm(n, avg, s)` generates `n` random numbers from the normal distribution with average `avg` and standard deviation `s`.

By generating random numbers from the normal distribution, we can simulate height data with similar properties to our dataset. Here we generate simulated height data using the normal distribution.

### Code: Generating normally distributed random numbers

```{r}
# define x as male heights from dslabs data
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)

# generate simulated height data using normal distribution - both datasets should have n observations
n <- length(x)
avg <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
simulated_heights <- rnorm(n, avg, s)

# plot distribution of simulated_heights
data.frame(simulated_heights = simulated_heights) %>%
    ggplot(aes(simulated_heights)) +
    geom_histogram(color="black", binwidth = 2)
```

### Code: Monte Carlo simulation of tallest person over 7 feet

```{r}
B <- 10000
tallest <- replicate(B, {
    simulated_data <- rnorm(800, avg, s)    # generate 800 normally distributed random heights
    max(simulated_data)    # determine the tallest height
})
mean(tallest >= 7*12)    # proportion of times that tallest person exceeded 7 feet (84 inches)
```

## Other continuous distributions

-   You may encounter other continuous distributions (Student t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, etc.).

-   R provides functions for density (`d`), quantile (`q`), probability distribution (`p`) and random number generation (`r`) for many of these distributions.

-   Each distribution has a matching abbreviation (for example, `norm()` or `t()`) that is paired with the related function abbreviations (**`d`**`, p, q, r`) to create appropriate functions.

-   For example, use `rt()` to generate random numbers for a Monte Carlo simulation using the Student t distribution.

### Code: Plotting the normal distribution with dnorm

Use d to plot the density function of a continuous distribution. Here is the density function for the normal distribution (abbreviation `norm()`):

```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
data.frame(x, f = dnorm(x)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x,f)) +
    geom_line()
```
