# Section 2 Overview

Section 2 introduces you to Continuous Probability.

After completing Section 2, you will:

-   understand the differences between calculating probabilities for discrete and continuous data.

-   be able to use cumulative distribution functions to assign probabilities to intervals when dealing with continuous data.

-   be able to use R to generate normally distributed outcomes for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

-   know some of the useful theoretical continuous distributions in addition to the normal distribution, such as the student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, and beta-binomial distributions.

# 2.1 Continuous Probability

## Continuous Probability

### Code: Cumulative distribution function

Define `x` as male heights from the **dslabs** `heights` dataset:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)
```

Given a vector **`x`**, we can define a function for computing the CDF of **`x`** using:

```{r}
F <- function(a) mean(x <= a)
1 - F(70)    # probability of male taller than 70 inches
```

## Theoretical Distribution

### Code: Using `pnorm()` to calculate probabilities

Given male heights `x`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)
```

We can estimate the probability that a male is taller than 70.5 inches using:

```{r}
1 - pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x))
```

### Code: Discretization and the normal approximation

```{r}
# plot distribution of exact heights in data
plot(prop.table(table(x)), xlab = "a = Height in inches", ylab = "Pr(x = a)")

# probabilities in actual data over length 1 ranges containing an integer
mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)

# probabilities in normal approximation match well
pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(67.5, mean(x), sd(x))
pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x))
pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x))

# probabilities in actual data over other ranges don't match normal approx as well
mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x <= 70.1)
pnorm(70.9, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(70.1, mean(x), sd(x))
```
