# Brexit poll analysis - Part 1

### Overview

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum to determine whether the country would “Remain” in the European Union (EU) or “Leave” the EU. This referendum is commonly known as Brexit. Although the media and others interpreted poll results as forecasting “Remain” ( 𝑝\>0.5) , the actual proportion that voted “Remain” was only 48.1% (𝑝=0.481) and the UK thus voted to leave the EU. Pollsters in the UK were criticized for overestimating support for “Remain”.

### Important definitions

#### Data Import

Import the `brexit_polls` polling data from the **dslabs** package and set options for the analysis:

```{r}
# suggested libraries and options
library(tidyverse)
options(digits = 3)

# load brexit_polls object
library(dslabs)
data(brexit_polls)
```

#### Final Brexit parameters

Define 𝑝=0.481 as the actual percent voting “Remain” on the Brexit referendum and 𝑑=2𝑝−1=−0.038 as the actual spread of the Brexit referendum with “Remain” defined as the positive outcome:

```{r}
p <- 0.481    # official proportion voting "Remain"
d <- 2*p-1    # official spread
```

### Question 1: Expected value and standard error of a poll 

The final proportion of voters choosing “Remain” was 𝑝=0.481 . Consider a poll with a sample of 𝑁=1500 voters.

What is the expected total number of voters in the sample choosing “Remain”?

```{r}
N <- 1500
N*p
```

What is the standard error of the total number of voters in the sample choosing “Remain”?

```{r}
sqrt(N*p*(1-p))
```

What is the expected value of 𝑋̂ , the proportion of “Remain” voters?

```{r}
p
```

What is the standard error of 𝑋̂ , the proportion of “Remain” voters?

```{r}
sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```

What is the expected value of 𝑑 , the spread between the proportion of “Remain” voters and “Leave” voters?

```{r}
2*p-1
```

What is the standard error of 𝑑 , the spread between the proportion of “Remain” voters and “Leave” voters?

```{r}
2*sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```

### Question 2: Actual Brexit poll estimates 

Load and inspect the brexit_polls dataset from dslabs, which contains actual polling data for the 6 months before the Brexit vote. Raw proportions of voters preferring “Remain”, “Leave”, and “Undecided” are available (remain, leave, undecided) The spread is also available (spread), which is the difference in the raw proportion of voters choosing “Remain” and the raw proportion choosing “Leave”.

Calculate x_hat for each poll, the estimate of the proportion of voters choosing “Remain” on the referendum day ( 𝑝=0.481 ), given the observed spread and the relationship 𝑑̂ =2𝑋̂ −1 . Use mutate() to add a variable x_hat to the brexit_polls object by filling in the skeleton code below:

What is the average of the observed spreads (spread)?

```{r}

```

What is the standard deviation of the observed spreads?

```{r}

```

What is the average of x_hat, the estimates of the parameter

```{r}

```

What is the standard deviation of x_hat?

```{r}

```
