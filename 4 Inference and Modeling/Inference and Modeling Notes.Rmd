# Section 1: Parameters and Estimates

# Section 1 Overview

Section 1 introduces you to parameters and estimates.

After completing Section 1, you will be able to:

-   Understand how to use a sampling model to perform a poll.

-   Explain the terms **population**, **parameter**, and **sample** as they relate to statistical inference.

-   Use a sample to estimate the population proportion from the sample average.

-   Calculate the expected value and standard error of the sample average.

# Sampling Model Parameters and Estimates

-   The task of statistical inference is to estimate an unknown population parameter using observed data from a sample.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In a sampling model, the collection of elements in the urn is called the *population.*

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A *parameter* is a number that summarizes data for an entire population.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A *sample* is observed data from a subset of the population.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   An *estimate* is a summary of the observed data about a parameter that we believe is informative. It is a data-driven guess of the population parameter.

-   The sample proportion is a random variable. Sampling gives random results drawn from the population distribution.

### Code: Function for taking a random draw from a specific urn

The **dslabs** package includes a function for taking a random draw of size n from the urn described in the video:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
ds_theme_set()
take_poll(25)    # draw 25 beads
```

### The Sample Average

### Polling versus Forecasting

-   A poll taken in advance of an election estimates p for that moment, not for election day.

-   In order to predict election results, forecasters try to use early estimates of p to predict p on election day. We discuss some approaches in later sections.

# Assessment 1.1: Parameters and Estimates

# Exercise 1. Polling - expected value of S

1\. Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion p of voters are Democrats and 1−p are Republicans. Your sample size is N=25. Consider the random variable S which is the **total** number of Democrats in your sample. What is the expected value of this random variable? Hint: it’s a function of p.

Ans. E(S) = 25 \* p

# Exercise 2. Polling - standard error of S

![](images/clipboard-3851961928.png)

2\. What is the standard error of S ? Hint: it’s a function of p.

# Exercise 3. Polling - expected value of X-bar

![![](images/clipboard-1955129058.png){width="122"}](images/clipboard-2815746691.png)

3\. Consider the random variable S/N. This is equivalent to the sample average, which we have been denoting as ¯X. What is the expected value of the ¯X? Hint: it’s a function of p.

# Exercise 4. Polling - standard error of X-bar

![](images/clipboard-378992676.png){width="126"}

4\. What is the standard error of ¯X? Hint: it’s a function of p.

# Exercise 5. se versus p

Write a line of code that calculates the standard error `se` of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats `p` that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats).

Plot `se` versus `p` for the 100 different proportions.

-   Use the `seq` function to generate a vector of 100 values of `p` that range from 0 to 1.

-   Use the `sqrt` function to generate a vector of standard errors for all values of `p`.

-   Use the `plot` function to generate a plot with `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis.

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0,1, length.out = 100)
p

# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average
se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
se
# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis
plot(p, se)
```

# Exercise 6. Multiple plots of se versus p

![](images/clipboard-1439325597.png)

-   Your for-loop should contain two lines of code to be repeated for three different values of N.

-   The first line within the for-loop should use the `sqrt` function to generate a vector of standard errors `se` for all values of `p`.

-   The second line within the for-loop should use the `plot` function to generate a plot with `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis.

-   Use the `ylim` argument to keep the y-axis limits constant across all three plots. The lower limit should be equal to 0 and the upper limit should equal 0.1 (it can be shown that this value is the highest calculated standard error across all values of `p` and `N`).

```{r}
# The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`. Plot the three graphs, using the `ylim` argument to standardize the y-axis across all three plots.
for(n in sample_sizes){
    se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/sample_sizes)
    plot(p, se, ylim = c(0, 0.1))
}
```

# Exercise 9. Standard error of the spread

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.
2*sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```

### The Central Limit Theorem in Practice

### Code: Computing the probability of Xbar  being within .01 of p

```{r}
X_hat <- 0.48
se <- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/25)
pnorm(0.01/se) - pnorm(-0.01/se)
```
