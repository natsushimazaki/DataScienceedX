# Section 1: Parameters and Estimates

# Section 1 Overview

Section 1 introduces you to parameters and estimates.

After completing Section 1, you will be able to:

-   Understand how to use a sampling model to perform a poll.

-   Explain the terms **population**, **parameter**, and **sample** as they relate to statistical inference.

-   Use a sample to estimate the population proportion from the sample average.

-   Calculate the expected value and standard error of the sample average.

# Sampling Model Parameters and Estimates

-   The task of statistical inference is to estimate an unknown population parameter using observed data from a sample.

```{=html}

```
-   In a sampling model, the collection of elements in the urn is called the *population.*

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A *parameter* is a number that summarizes data for an entire population.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A *sample* is observed data from a subset of the population.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   An *estimate* is a summary of the observed data about a parameter that we believe is informative. It is a data-driven guess of the population parameter.

-   The sample proportion is a random variable. Sampling gives random results drawn from the population distribution.

### Code: Function for taking a random draw from a specific urn

The **dslabs** package includes a function for taking a random draw of size n from the urn described in the video:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
take_poll(25)    # draw 25 beads
```
